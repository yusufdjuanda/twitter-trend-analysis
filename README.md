# Twitter Data Analysis: Local and Global Thought Patterns

## Project Overview

This project is part of the learning project provided by DataCamp.

Twitter has an undeniable influence on global communication, shaping the thoughts and moods of people around the world. From significant events to trending topics, Twitter-storms offer a unique opportunity for real-time analysis of public sentiment and global thought patterns.

This project focuses on exploring Twitter data to uncover insights into these thought patterns, both locally and globally. While Twitter's API typically requires authentication to access data, we've simplified the process by providing a pre-collected dataset in the `datasets` folder. This allows us to dive straight into the analysis, bypassing the usual data collection hurdles.

### Key Objectives

1. **Understand Global Thought Patterns**: Analyze the tweets to gain insights into the prevailing moods and thoughts expressed on a global scale.
2. **Explore Localized Trends**: Examine how specific events or topics resonate in different parts of the world, reflected in the Twitter data.
3. **Learn Data Extraction and Analysis Techniques**: Focus on extracting meaningful insights from the provided Twitter data using various data analysis techniques.
